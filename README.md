# Syllabus for "Software Engineering"

* **Course:** [COSCS-340]
* ** MK404  MWF  12:20PM-01:10PM (Min Kao 404) **
* **Instructor:** Audris Mockus, [audris@utk.edu](mailto:audris@utk.edu) office hours MK613 - on request
* **TA:** Andrew Valesky, [avalesky@vols.utk.edu](mailto:avalesky@vols.utk.edu) office hours MK619 TBD

* **Need help?**

Simple rules: 

1. There are no stupid questions. However, it may be worth going over the following steps:
1. Think of what the right answer may be.
1. Search online: stack overflow, etc.
     - code snippets: On GH [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) or, if anyone contributes, [for this class](https://github.com/snippets/COSCS340/)
     - answers to questions: [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
1. Look through [issues](https://github.com/COSCS340/news/issues)
1. Post the question as an issue.
1. Ask instructor: [email](mailto:audris@utk.edu) for 1-on-1 help, or
   to set up a time to meet 

## Objectives
The course will provide basic software engineering approaches with a
focus on intense practice.

- Version control and issue tracking
- Basic software project management
- Build
- Test
- Deploy to the cloud

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion, students will be able to
work in teams, break work into iterations, write tests,
and deploy their software to the cloud.


## Course Description

TBD

## Prerequisites

TBD

All the assignments and projects for this class will use github.


While we have strived to make the programming component of this course
straightforward, we will not devote much time to teaching
programming. You should feel comfortable with:

1. How to look up syntax on Google and StackOverflow.
1. Basic programming concepts like functions, loops, arrays, dictionaries, strings, and if statements.
1. How to learn new libraries by reading documentation and reusing examples
1. Asking questions on StackOverflow or as a GitHub issue.

### Requirements

These apply to real life, as well.

* Must apply "good programming style" learned in class
    * Optimize for readability

## Teaming Tips

* Agree on an editor and environment that you're comfortable with
* The person who's less experienced/comfortable should have more keyboard time
* Switch who's "driving" regularly
* Make sure to save the code and send it to others on the team

## Evaluation

* Class Participation â€“ 15%: students are expected to read all
   material covered in a week and come to class prepared to take
   part in the classroom discussions. Responding to other student
   questions (issues) counts as classroom participation.

* Assignments - 40%: Each assignment will involve writing (or modifying a template of)
   a small Python program.

* Project - 45%: one original project done alone or in a group of 2 or 3
   students. The project will explore one or more of the themes covered
   in the course that students find particularly compelling.  The
   group needs to submit a project proposal (2 pages IEEE format).  The proposal
   should provide a brief motivation of the project, detailed
   discussion of the data that will be obtained or used in the project,
   along with a time-line of milestones, and expected outcome.

## Other considerations

As a programmer you will never write anything from scratch, but will
reuse code, frameworks, or ideas.  You are encouraged to
learn from the work of your peers. However, if you don't try to do
it yourself, you will not learn. [Deliberate practice][deliberate-practice]
(activities designed for the sole purpose of effectively improving
specific aspects of an individual's performance) is the only way to
reach perfection.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find,
and if you re-implement or duplicate an algorithm or code from
elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.

[Academic Dishonesty / Plagiarism]

Cheating and plagiarism are serious offenses and are grounds for
dismissal from the course and an automatic F grade. Please read UT's
honor statement. for more information on what constitutes plagiarism
and what actions may be taken if the honor statement is violated. I
have written a helpful guide to avoiding plagiarism. The guide is
from my COSC102 course, but it is still relevant. 

Any plagiarism/cheating on an exam will be an automatic F for the
course and a referral. Any plagiarism/cheating on homework will
result in a 0 for that homework or assignment. 

Any repeat offenses in plagiarism/cheating will be an automatic F
for the course. 

Bottom line: It isn't worth it.....PLEASE don't do it!

Any cheating, plagiarism, etc. will be punished in accordance with
the current version of Hilltopics. For more information see
