## A system to support social interaction analysis  Mining Tweets for Analysis of Hurricane Disaster Response

Given a set of twitter accounts, the system retrieves, store, cleans, and does basic text processing and/or social network 
analysis on the set of accounts and accounts that interacted with these accounts. 
Background:
In Fall 2017, hurricanes rampaged along the southern coast of the U.S. Many were left without power for a significant amount of time as they waited for utility companies to respond to the damage caused by the hurricane. There were also other social and environmental issue arose.
Project goal: 
The goal of this research is to investigate the nature of tweet content generated within the time span of natural disasters, Hurricane Irma and Harvey in 2017. This project aims to examine what information was available during the prodromal stage, how this information developed and exchanged during the period of time, and the implications that these patterns of public opinion and information may have for those attempting to manage a similar large-scale emergency. Some potential research questions including: 
1. Which important issues (e.g., power-infrastructre, social-envrionmental imapcts) did people tweet about along the timeline of the hurricane (before, during, and after)?
2. What was the information (or topic, theme) most retweeted at different stages of the hurricane?
3. Any complaints about governmental actions, first responders (police, fire department, medical), and other services (e.g., power, sewage, etc.)?
4. What are the major environmental issues discussed related to the hurricane by the tweeters? Did public awareness of environmental issues change along the course of the hurricane?
5. How does the data suggest the places for improvement (in infrastructure, responses, etc.) during major natural disasters like this?
Tasks:
    Data preparation: To obtain the relevant tweets from various Twitter accounts- media, government/officials, NGOs, and personal), store the tweets, remove spam, irrelevant and redundant tweets.
    Data analysis: topic analysis, sentiment analysis,  keyword analysis, etc., using computer programming.

## Forensic database of images

In this project, you will learn to apply machine learning techniques to images. OpenCV is the recommended tool and Python is the recommended programming language. You may also use other machine learning models, such as deep learning if you can get high performance. The project has two milestone objectives – image classification and object detection.

    Problem 1 – Image Classification

You will be given a dataset - “body” which contains annotated sub-images of body parts, including ear, eye, hair, head, left foot, and mouth. These labeled sub-images will serve as the ground truth. The problem is as follows, can you provide a machine learning algorithm to automatically label new sub-images? Here are a few tips using OpenCV. For each image, you will be able to extract keypoints representing high-level features. Read through ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) and Feature Matching to get some ideas. Then you need to try out classifying the sub-images based on the detected keypoints. Note that each image may have a different number of keypoints and different keypoints may represent different features. Binary classification, for instance, left foot vs. eye AND left foot vs. others, are desired. Ten-fold cross-validation could be used to measure and improve the model performance. Finally, you need to write up the algorithm, chosen parameters, and classification performance (i.e., mean and std of accuracy).

    Problem 2 – Object Detection

In the Problem 1, you are given the annotated sub-images. The harder problem would be, how can you detect the body parts from the full images, which may contain multiple body parts? Note that when you detect left foot, only some of the full images contain this body part. Same with the other body parts.

This problem contains two image datasets. One is exactly the one used in Problem 1, another is the dataset of the full images - “images”. Moreover, the two datasets are connected via the file “tags.csv”. In the CSV file, the column “ID” contains the sub-images’ names, the column “tag” gives the tag of each sub-image, and the column “Image” tells which full image the sub-image is from. There are several ideas to solve this problem. One idea is that you can split the full image into several (i.e., 3 * 4) sub-images and classify the sub-images based on the model you train when solving Problem 1. Another idea is that the full image should contain left foot if it contains sufficiently many similar keypoints from the annotated left foot sub-images.

     

## ECG data

https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/

The 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge aims to encourage the development of algorithms to classify, from a single short ECG lead recording (between 30 s and 60 s in length), whether the recording shows normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation (AF), an alternative rhythm, or is too noisy to be classified.

ECG recordings, collected using the AliveCor device, were generously donated for this Challenge by AliveCor. The training set contains 8,528 single lead ECG recordings lasting from 9 s to just over 60 s (see Table 2) and the test set contains 3,658 ECG recordings of similar lengths. The test set is unavailable to the public and will remain private for the purpose of scoring for the duration of the Challenge and for some period afterwards.

ECG recordings were sampled as 300 Hz and they have been band pass filtered by the AliveCor device. All data are provided in MATLAB V4 WFDB-compliant format (each including a .mat file containing the ECG and a .hea file containing the waveform information). More details of the training set can be seen in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the examples of the ECG waveforms (lasting for 20 s) for the four classes in this Challenge. From top to bottom, they are ECG waveforms of normal rhythm, AF rhythm, other rhythm and noisy recordings.
